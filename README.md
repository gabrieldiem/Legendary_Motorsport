### Configuraci√≥n de la base de datos

First, the database setup must be run, which loads the data from the ```seeds.rb``` file at the beginning, so that an administrator account with preloaded cars appears when starting the server. This is done with the command  ```rails db:setup```.

Then, the database migrations must be executed, which is done with the command ```rails db:migrate```.

### Server Execution

Finally, to run the server that shows the website locally, the command ```rails s``` must be executed.

This will start the server so that the website can be seen at ```http://localhost:3000/```.
